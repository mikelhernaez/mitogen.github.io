Welcome to Mitogen.

In the past years, the members of the Mitogen group have commonly designed a large set of compression solutions for genomic data in order to mitigate the challenge of storing and exchanging of genomic data. To help users and researchers to use, investigate, and adapt these solutions, we merged all our compression solutions into this common repository.
Additionally, you will find all (adapted) tools that were used for our research.

Enjoy :-).
